# OfxEditorFlask (NOTE: This is no longer running on AWS)

The frontend of this application was originally going to be used in an embedded server in the FLX pedal:

https://github.com/ephlexaudio/OfxEditorFlask

The backend has been modified to use MongoDB in place of the original JSON formatted text files.
